We work collaboratively with academics and experts in economics, data science, machine learning, statistics, finance, marketing, accounting, and healthcare. Our collaborative teams span eight offices and total over 700 full-time employees.

ABOUT THE TEAM

Our ultimate goal is to use the best software, models and practices to deliver high-quality analysis in the cleanest, streamlined, and accurate manner possible. Some examples of the work the team has done to answer specific questions in the past include:
Fine-tuning the Detectron2 ML model to identify specific products inside of hundreds ofthousands of images found across social media – were influencers promoting the use of adangerous product?
Creating novel geospatial data visualizations of industry concentrations in particular regions ofthe United States – were there opportunities for monopolistic behavior among merging firms?
Developing API pipelines from dozens of public and private sources to collect economic, financial,legal, and healthcare data – how can our team automate relevant data collection so we can focusmore of our time on meaningful modeling and analysis?
Building semi-supervised NLP models to categorize free-form text found among millions ofTwitter posts – were adult brands targeting minors in a harmful way?

These shared skills are used to deliver high quality data products to our experts and consulting teams to cut through data complexities and clarify the most reissues underlying major litigation disputes or investigations.

WHAT WE DO

Axiom Data Science, a Tetra Tech Company, is a fast-moving and dynamic technology and informatics company with a mission to build a better understanding of society and the environment by increasing the accessibility, reuse, and impact of scientific data. To that end, we provide cyberinfrastructure support, data management systems, and scalable technical solutions for organizing and analyzing large amounts of diverse datasets to organizations across the globe. We’ve assembled an outstanding team of software and data engineers, data analysts, project managers, and data coordinators to tackle difficult problems and provide excellent support to our partners at businesses, non-profits, federal and state agencies, and universities.

We offer a flexible, collaborative working environment, and we have a company culture that promotes taking initiative, solving problems, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. We want to do great work, while being a great place to work. We are headquartered in Anchorage, AK and have satellite offices in Portland, OR; and North Kingstown, RI. Work location for this position is flexible and may be remote, though we would prefer someone in close proximity to one of our offices. Approximately ⅓ of Axiom currently works remotely.

Our work matters: if you want to make a difference in oceanography, climate science, or scientific data management, this is the place to do it. We work hard on interesting problems and push the boundaries of science and computing.


HOW WE WORK

We are a software-services company forming mutually beneficial partnerships with partners. We believe in focusing time and energy on our core products, and encouraging staff to take ownership of their work.

We are a geographically distributed company and collaborate with each other online. Strong communication skills are critical. We work together closely while minimizing distractions.

We have low administrative overhead. Staff are given all the tools they need to excel and are self-driven, resourceful, and instrumental in expanding our vision.


WHAT YOU WILL DO

Though the Axiom team works with scientific data, research is not our primary focus. Instead, we build visualization and analysis capabilities that make new insights possible, and work with our partners and stakeholders to build operational products on top of their data sets. Along the way, we adhere to open science standards by improving metadata and semantically linking datasets - transforming scientists’ research results into meaningful products that reach far beyond the initial intent.

As a data engineer, you’ll be part of this process. You will contribute to and advance our suite of scientific data management tools, techniques, and services. This requires looking beyond a single project, discipline or research interest. And it also demands teamwork and an ever broadening suite of individual skills. On a daily basis, you might:

Develop routines for extracting, transforming, manipulating, formatting, compiling, and curating large and complex geophysical and scientific data primarily from the coastal and ocean domains;
Develop and contribute to the existing data services that Axiom has built to handle large-scale scientific datasets;
Work with data librarians to translate scientific data, metadata, and analytic results into end-user products and APIs;
Prototype analysis code in Jupyter and migrate the code into our team’s operational data processing pipeline.


WHAT WE LOOK FOR

As a company taking on complex information and data science challenges, Axiom depends on all employees being multi-talented, imaginative, and resourceful. Staff are provided with the tools they need to perform at their highest level and rewarded with an employee-focused work environment. Data science exists at the intersection of three domains: computer science, mathematics and statistics, and scientific expertise. We are seeking a candidate who can contribute to each of these domains through prior experience handling and analyzing marine, atmospheric or geospatial data. Experience with community standard open-source tools and scientific data formats is important, but inspiration, vision, motivation, determination, and commitment are the qualities Axiom values most.

We are looking for a demonstrated history of working with real-world data, and that you have some of the following skills and experiences:

4+ years of relevant experience with a spectrum of environmental scientific data formats;
Experience programming with the core Python data science stack;
Experience with machine learning concepts, techniques, and frameworks;
Experience with the core concepts of software engineering (e.g. source control, continuous integration tools, unit testing and coding best practices);
Experience building and/or working with services and APIs on top of large scientific and/or geospatial datasets;
Experience with core geospatial concepts such as raster, vectors, projections and spatial operations as well as familiarity with open-standards based GIS tooling and storage formats (e.g., GeoTIFF, GeoDatabase, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, GeoJSON);
Willingness to dive in and embrace other aspects of our data processing stack: Linux, Docker, Jupyter, Spark, GeoServer, Dask, Ray, TimescaleDB, Parquet/Arrow
Self-motivation, independence, flexibility, and a problem-solving attitude

Degree / Certifications
Degree in computer science, statistics, mathematics, or similar quantitative discipline; or a degree in the physical and/or environmental sciences (oceanography, meteorology, etc.) with quantitative and programming experience.


Work Environment
This position may travel occasionally (<10%) for professional meetings and/or to one of our central offices

The Salary Range for this position is $70,000 - $120,000
Applicants should submit a resume and/or cover letter describing how your experiences fit with the desired qualifications and what drove you to apply for the position.

Job Description
We're building a bitcoin wallet for the next 100M bitcoin users - importantly for people around the world who likely haven't yet used bitcoin as a savings tool or for its payments capabilities yet. Our goal is economic empowerment - starting with bringing easy-to-use, reliable wallet that helps people around the world own and manage their bitcoin, rather than having to rely on several tools and services that don't work well together and are challenging to use for a wide global audience.
Our goal is to make the future of money intuitive, and safe while helping customers build a better financial future. We're assembling a team experienced in an extremely wide range of disciplines, including business, operations, design, software, hardware, security, and so many other aspects of product delivery.
We are hiring our first Product Data Scientist to help our product, marketing, engineering and customer support teams make data-driven decisions about what and how we build for our customers when helping them manage their money. This is a unique opportunity to not only be embedded with an early stage team where you'll have close proximity to strategy and building so you can produce action-oriented analyses, but you'll also influence our data infrastructure and tooling decisions.
Because you will work with bitcoin data across different sources (internal systems, blockchain, lightning network, etc.), an understanding of how these technologies function or demonstrated experience or interest working with this data is a big plus.
You will report to our Head of Business within Bitcoin Wallet. You can be based anywhere remotely in the United States, as well as in several countries around the world including the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, among other countries.
Come build the future of money with us! Learn more through our newsletter here.
You Will:
Empower our team to use data to make business decisions as we build a global product from its earliest days- an opportunity to build data analysis into the infrastructure of a team from day 1
Develop both backwards-looking analysis on product performance, marketing effectiveness, monetization and pricing and other main product and business decisions, as well as forward-looking predictive models to help us better understand customers and their needs (e.g. cluster analysis that help us map customer segments back to product usage, retention models)
Empower the teams with data and help them to make decisions on improving product features and building a meaningful roadmap (e.g. funnel metrics, analysis of churn and CS data, etc), as well as influencing important decisions like pricing based on acquisition and retention insights
As a member of the Business team, you'll have the product and business context to be able to proactively spot trends and connect sometimes seemingly disconnected data sets to help the team develop and prove out hypotheses across the end to end lifecycle, forming cohort analysis on things like acquisition channels, etc.
Navigate external data sets such as publicly available blockchain data insights (eg bitcoin blockchain analysis) to help us understand things like our total addressable market (TAM) as well as SAM and SOM
Design and help run statistically-significant experiments across different cohorts of customers and ensure hygienic approach to things like causation vs correlation
Create models that help us to analyze risk and security threats as well as optimize key decisions on our approach to money movement (i.e. transaction modeling)
Support and guide in our early data infrastructure decisions with product and engineering - as we are a zero to one team, you will get to shape the data infrastructure decisions we make so we have scalable ways of working where data is easily accessible to the right people on our team, all while ensuring that data is secure and aligned with our privacy principles and commitment to customers and partners.
Qualifications
You Have:
Background in working in product-driven organizations and building and sharing data-driven insights to help make decisions with 8+ years of experience
Experience with cohort and funnel analyses, an understanding of statistical concepts such as selection bias, probability distributions, and conditional probabilities
Experience telling stories and making relevant recommendations with data
You've set up and run A/B tests and other types of experimentation designs and can help ensure statistical significance in the right testing environment
With technical skills, you can automate complex processes and construct data pipelines
Experience with data visualization tools (e.g. Looker, PowerBI, Tableau etc.)
Work in collaborative team environments including Product, Marketing, Engineering, Design and Research
Thrives in earlier stage environments - you're a self-starter who gets excited about complex, sometimes vague, or longer-term problems and can be creative on how to solve those problems with data and insights
Familiarity or interest in learning blockchain analytics as we are building in the bitcoin space and external data sets will help you uncover richer trends and recommendations; ability to connect internal and external data sources
Technical skills: Python or R, Advanced SQL

Data Scientist,"Company Description
Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.
Job Description
Square is growing its financial services footprint through the launch of new products and international expansions. This is an exciting time for our business and we are looking for a Data Scientist to join our Finance and Strategy Banking team to lead analytical and strategic projects for our banking business.
This position will be fundamental in shaping our product strategy and communicating critical decisions to Product leadership, our Bank partners and to Block management. Success in this role requires the ability to exercise excellent business acumen while often operating autonomously without existing problem solving frameworks or precedent solutions. We are thus looking for someone with a strong analytical background who can manage and drive solutions across a variety of strategic and financially focused challenges.
As a Data Scientist, you will be embedded within the Square Banking Finance & Strategy team, leveraging data analytics, statistics, and predictive modeling techniques to empower data-driven decision making across our growing suite of financial products offered to Square sellers. In this role, you will collaborate closely with Business Intelligence, Finance, Product Management, Marketing and other cross-functional team members to drive recommendations that influence the direction of our Square Banking business.
Candidates can sit in any Square office in the US or be remote from any US state with the exception of Alaska.
You Will:
Apply a diverse set of tactics such as statistics, quantitative reasoning, and machine learning to analyze key performance indicators
Partner with senior leaders and partners to surface analytical trends that influence business decisions across our credit and banking products
Develop data driven models to forecast the performance and growth of our products
Provide comprehensive analytics, develop tools and resources to empower data access and self-service to partner teams
Collaborate across Marketing, Capital Markets, and Business Intelligence (among other teams) to identify and understand complex relationships between key drivers of our business
Qualifications
You Have:
5+ years of analytics experience and a Bachelor's degree or equivalent
Fluency in SQL and familiar with a scripting language like Python
Experience exploring and understanding complex datasets and data systems, leveraging statistical and machine-learning techniques to solve practical business problems such as hypothesis testing, cross-selling, clustering user archetypes, and predicting churn
Experience working with technical and non-technical partners, such as product managers and product marketing managers, on product development and growth initiatives
Strong communication skills: ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences in verbal, visual, and written media
Demonstrated exceptional achievement in a fast-paced, cross-functional environment
Commitment to Square's purpose of Economic Empowerment
[Bonus] An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.) in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Physical Sciences, Economics, or a related technical field
[Bonus] Background with banking products, such as loans or credit/debit cards

Job summary
Would you like to help us build the next-generation cloud services that will power the largest managed infrastructure in the world? We’re hiring a Data Scientist for AWS Compute Optimizer team within Amazon AWS Insights. Our service uses large amounts of data combined with machine learning (ML) and push the boundaries of scale, availability, and performance, while maintaining the highest standards for security and operational excellence.

AWS Compute Optimizer helps you choose optimal configurations for three types of AWS resources: Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, and AWS Lambda functions, based on your utilization data. By applying the knowledge drawn from Amazon’s own experience running diverse workloads in the cloud, Compute Optimizer identifies workload patterns and recommends optimal AWS resources. Compute Optimizer analyzes the configuration and resource utilization of your workload to identify dozens of defining characteristics, for example, if a workload is CPU-intensive, if it exhibits a daily pattern, or if a workload accesses local storage frequently. The service processes these characteristics and identifies the hardware resource required by the workload. Compute Optimizer infers how the workload would have performed on various hardware platforms (e.g. Amazon EC2 instances types) or using different configurations (e.g. Amazon EBS volume IOPS settings, and AWS Lambda function memory sizes) to offer recommendations.

You will take on challenges in providing recommendations based on billions of metric records available for various customers and their use cases. You will be empowered to think big, invent on behalf of our customers, make judgment calls and find elegant solutions to hard problems.

How You Will Be Evaluated
You will be evaluated for this job based on how well you meet the qualifications above.
As this position is being advertised under DEU and Merit Promotion hiring procedures, applicants will be rated on the extent and quality of experience and education relevant to the duties of the position using the hiring procedures outlined below.
How You Will Be Evaluated-DEU Hiring Procedures
The FCC determines the BEST QUALIFIED CANDIDATES based on the major job related competencies and evaluation of your knowledge, skills, and abilities reflected in your application and supporting documents using the CATEGORY RATING PROCESS. Time in grade restrictions do not apply to DEU hiring procedures.
All eligible applicants under Delegated Examining (DEU) will be placed in one of the following three categories:
1. Highly Qualified (Score 90-100) - the applicants possessing a background that demonstrates a superior level of major job related competencies and possession of all evaluation criteria;
2. Fully Qualified (Score 80-89) - the applicants possessing a background that demonstrates a satisfactory level of major job related competencies and possession of the evaluation criteria; and
3. Minimally Qualified (Score of 70-79)- the applicants possessing only the specialized experience described in the vacancy announcement. An automated score is administered based on the on-line application process used.
Eligible applicants will receive a numerical rating based on their responses to the job specific questions for this position. Application of Veterans Preference: The category rating process does not add veterans' preference points or apply the ""rule of three"" but protects the rights of veterans by placing them ahead of non-preference eligibles within each category. Preference eligibles who meet the minimum qualification requirements and who have compensable service-connected disability at least 10 percent MUST be listed in the highest quality category, except when the position being filled is scientific or professional at the GS-9 grade level or higher.
A selecting official may make selection from the highest quality category (""HIGHLY QUALIFIED"") provided no preference eligible in that category is passed over to select a non-preference eligible in the same category. Qualified disabled veterans (30% disabled veterans and at least 10% disabled veterans) who meet the qualification criteria float to the top of the Highly Qualified category and by law must be referred over non-veterans. Non-veterans are strictly prohibited from being referred or selected over qualified disabled veterans.
There are several parts to the application process that affect the overall evaluation of your application including:
1. the core questions
2. the vacancy questions
3. supplemental documentation (e.g., DD-214, SF-50, SF-15, transcripts), if applicable; and
4. your resume.
Applicants will be rated ineligible, if they do not respond to job specific questions, provide supplemental documents and submit resume. For more information, please click on Rating Process.

The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.
We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is truly saying.
We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.

Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants.

This role is an in-house mathematician role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.

The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.

Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.

We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.

Requirements:
Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis.
Excellent graduate-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths.

Why Cisco
We are cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

It's time to build. Whether it's creating more housing, upgrading our infrastructure, or adapting to climate change, one thing is clear: the construction industry is at the center of solving our biggest problems. We're making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.
Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we can't live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices. Despite this, there's been very little innovation over the past 70 years in how materials - which constitute up to 40% of project costs - are bought and sold. This is our opportunity.
About the Role:
We are looking for our first ever Data Scientist at Kojo. The ideal candidate will be excited to evolve our existing data and tools to take our data-driven insights and decision-making to the next level. This role is initially part of our ""Materials"" engineering team that focuses on our catalog data, and will play a key role in building out our data science team over time.

Working with cross-functional teams to analyze Kojo's app usage data and deliver insights that drive key business decisions
Developing new techniques and data sources to uncover or mine data to predict current or future trends
Helping grow the foundations of a new part of Kojo's engineering organization, from process, to hiring, to culture
About you:
You're obsessive about using data to discover new knowledge and drive decision-making
You're looking for a place you can make an outsized impact
A team player who enjoys learning, teaching, and solving problems across multiple teams
Good with communication, managing your time, and setting expectations
You have a Bachelor's degree in an analytical field such as statistics, operations research, economics, computer science or many others, or equivalent experience
You're an expert at:
Data modeling, data analysis, ETL, and segmentation techniques
Extracting and aggregating data from sizable data sets using SQL or other tools
Writing performant SQL queries especially with regards to join operations on normalized data
Tools you're probably familiar with:
PostgreSQL or similar relational databases
Data visualization tools (e.g. Superset, Power BI, Tableau, Looker) or user analytics platforms such as Analytics or Mixpanel
Data warehousing with platforms such as Redshift or Snowflake
Expertise with at least one data science tool such as Python or R
Nice to have: Experience working with any other construction software or construction industry data

Data Scientist,"Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Job Description

Square is growing its financial services footprint through the launch of new products and international expansions. This is an exciting time for our business and we are looking for a Data Scientist to join our Finance and Strategy Banking team to lead analytical and strategic projects for our banking business.
This position will be fundamental in shaping our product strategy and communicating critical decisions to Product leadership, our Bank partners and to Block management. Success in this role requires the ability to exercise excellent business acumen while often operating autonomously without existing problem solving frameworks or precedent solutions. We are thus looking for someone with a strong analytical background who can manage and drive solutions across a variety of strategic and financially focused challenges.
As a Data Scientist, you will be embedded within the Square Banking Finance & Strategy team, leveraging data analytics, statistics, and predictive modeling techniques to empower data-driven decision making across our growing suite of financial products offered to Square sellers. In this role, you will collaborate closely with Business Intelligence, Finance, Product Management, Marketing and other cross-functional team members to drive recommendations that influence the direction of our Square Banking business.
Candidates can sit in any Square office in the US or be remote from any US state with the exception of Alaska.
You Will:
Apply a diverse set of tactics such as statistics, quantitative reasoning, and machine learning to analyze key performance indicators
Partner with senior leaders and partners to surface analytical trends that influence business decisions across our credit and banking products
Develop data driven models to forecast the performance and growth of our products
Provide comprehensive analytics, develop tools and resources to empower data access and self-service to partner teams
Collaborate across Marketing, Capital Markets, and Business Intelligence (among other teams) to identify and understand complex relationships between key drivers of our business

Qualifications

You Have:
5+ years of analytics experience and a Bachelor's degree or equivalent
Fluency in SQL and familiar with a scripting language like Python
Experience exploring and understanding complex datasets and data systems, leveraging statistical and machine-learning techniques to solve practical business problems such as hypothesis testing, cross-selling, clustering user archetypes, and predicting churn
Experience working with technical and non-technical partners, such as product managers and product marketing managers, on product development and growth initiatives
Strong communication skills: ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences in verbal, visual, and written media
Demonstrated exceptional achievement in a fast-paced, cross-functional environment
Commitment to Square's purpose of Economic Empowerment
[Bonus] An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.) in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Physical Sciences, Economics, or a related technical field
[Bonus] Background with banking products, such as loans or credit/debit cards

ML Engineer,"One in two people experience debilitating back, neck, shoulder, or joint pain — but traditional treatments have failed to meet their needs. Physical therapy can be expensive and hard to access; appointments often involve long commutes and missed work.

Join us in reimagining healthcare from the ground up. We’re making high-quality care accessible by pairing wearable sensors and computer vision with a world-class clinical team. Hinge Health puts a digital clinic in every member's pocket. Now millions of people can access personalized digital care from a physical therapist, guidance on behavior change from a health coach, and expert consultations with an orthopedic surgeon. With a single app and wearable technology like our Enso device, we’re helping to reduce pain, surgeries, and opioid use.

Data Scientist,"Overview

The Data Science Team provides advanced analytical support across VNS Health’s health plans. We leverage big data to develop insights and to support strategic decisions for the agency. Meaningful, appropriate use of data is central to the success of our organization. We are looking for an ambitious data scientist to join our team.

Responsibilities

About the Role:
The Data Scientist will join a core group of analysts who play an important role in generating strategic insights across VNS Health’s health plans in these four applications of data science:
Costs & Revenue – “How are costs trending over time? Are our spending patterns in line with our revenues and the severity of our membership? “Our data scientists are knowledgeable about medical claims data and the risk-adjustment models that determine our revenues; analyze opportunities for cost saving strategies; forecast future expenditures; identify patterns of utilization among service providers, member cohorts and longitudinally over our member’s continuum of care.
Policy – “What is the impact of health care policy on our patient population? On our most vulnerable members? How will new payment methods affect the way we ensure quality care while managing costs? What partnerships can we develop to ensure that our members continue receiving optimal care?” Our data scientists are well-versed in healthcare policy; analyze areas for meaningful value investments that focus on improving health outcomes while minimizing spending.

Clinical – “Who are our most vulnerable members? What can we do to prevent or mitigate their poor health outcomes? When is the best time to implement these actions?” This application of data science examines the drivers of clinical outcomes; analyzes opportunities for managing risk-based populations; evaluates the effectiveness of programs and interventions that aim to improve member outcomes.

Quality & Satisfaction – “How is quality of care measured and how is it related to member outcomes? Where are opportunities to improve the quality of care and satisfaction of our members?” Our data scientists serve as subject matter experts on healthcare quality and satisfaction measurement and risk adjustment; identify viable opportunities for improvement in clinical processes that can lead to improved quality and member satisfaction.
You Are:
Looking for an opportunity to perform hands-on data analysis to solve a wide variety of business problems while working alongside clinical/business stakeholders
Driven by curiosity and a passion to learn, you thrive in situations where you can bring clarity to ambiguous and multi-faceted problems
A logical thinker who is comfortable learning new programming languages and computing applications independently
Obsessive about streamlining data and modeling processes; if you find you or your colleagues doing something several times, you create a standard reproducible workflow
Love the challenge of exploring new data sources while practicing a healthy skepticism about data; when you find data that looks wrong, you are emotionally compelled to figure out why
Have a desire to use your analytical skills to make measurable impacts on the lives of patients

To ensure compliance with an applicable preliminary nationwide injunction, which may be supplemented, modified, or vacated, depending on the course of ongoing litigation, the Federal Government will take no action to implement or enforce Executive Order 14043 Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees. Therefore, to the extent a federal job announcement includes the requirement to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 pursuant to Executive Order 14043, that requirement does not currently apply. Positions with vaccination requirements under authority(ies) separate and distinct from Executive Order 14043 will be clearly identified. HHS may continue to require documentation of proof of vaccination to ensure compliance with those policies. Health and safety protocols remain in effect, in accordance with CDC guidance and the Safer Federal Workforce Task force. Consistent with current guidance, workplace safety protocols will no longer vary based on vaccination status or otherwise depend on the availability of vaccination information. Therefore, to the extent a job announcement states that HHS may request information regarding the vaccination status of selected applicants for the purposes of implementing workplace safety protocols, this statement does not currently apply.

Our Onsite Publishing (OSP) organization is transforming Amazon.com by helping customers discover and research what they want to purchase by connecting them with product review content developed by creators of all types – from large publishers to individual influencers. This advises customers to make the best buying decisions by bringing third party, expert content into Amazon. Onsite publishing sources high-quality content from third-party publishers and influencers at scale, moderates, annotates, and vends it to internal experience owners within Amazon (e.g. Video Shopping, Storefronts, #FoundItonAmazon, StyleFeed), and monitors content performance. OSP also owns the content publishing tools along with select creator experiences. We believe that providing relevant, quality content across Amazon will increase long-term customer engagement along with product discovery and research.
The challenge that OSP owns is unique at Amazon in two ways: 1) OSP owns the end-to-end content workflows from ingestion to vending, and we must build robust Science methods to automate this at Amazon scale, and 2) We are building our workflows in a content agnostic way, but we will need ways to solve multi-content optimization, e.g. publisher articles that include photos and/or videos. and content ranking.

We are seeking a Principal Applied Scientist to both tackle our most complex problems and raise the bar for our Science colleagues within Amazon's Customer Engagement organization . This candidate will make long term investments in our unique challenge - to lead Amazon in the automated extraction, understanding, processing of knowledge and ranking of content. The knowledge we need to ingest are wide ranging in data type coverage, and are from varying external source formats. To accomplish our multi-year challenges, we need the candidate to lead R&D of ML models to ingest content from disparate sources as opposed to requiring creators to submit content in specific, rigid ways which currently stifles ingestion and on-boarding of content at scale today.

Key job responsibilities
This candidate will be the intellectual thought leader for the team, setting the working backwards path for our most complex problems. This individual will work closely with our Applied Scientist team, Principal Engineers, software development engineers, product managers and data engineers. In addition to solving problems, this candidate will raise the bar for our team by reviewing proposals and technical designs for the portfolio of problems we solve. The successful candidate will have a proven track record of breaking down and solving complex Science problems. In addition, you have strong business judgement and are an excellent communicator, with proven ability to influence at the most senior levels. You have the passion and experience to closely work with a diverse and innovative team that will delight customers and set new standards in our space. You are entrepreneurial and enjoy working in a dynamic, ambiguous, fast-paced environment. You are humble and have a track record of exceptional performance. People trust and respect you, and they like to work with and for you.

A day in the life
As the Principal Applied Scientist, you will work closely with the engineering, product, and data leaders to ensure we are prioritizing the right problems, ensuring long-term and resilient designs, and meeting the high quality bar and deadlines. You will take ownership over select problems and work with the team to implement into production. You will also spend time reviewing designs and mentoring our junior Science team members. You will also participate in learning opportunities for the broader Consumer Engagement Science community.

About the team
OSP consists of 1) Software Development Engineers, including a Principal Engineer, and Software Managers and Technical Program Managers, 2) Science leaders, including multiple Applied Scientists, Data Scientists, and Data Engineers, and 3) Product Manager-Technical, which help prioritize and work backwards to experiment.

Our talented and dedicated team members constantly look for responsible ways to serve our customers when, where and how they want.

The Roku Culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Data Scientist,"Together MD is a disruptive data analytics startup in the healthcare space. Using a big data approach to healthcare utilization management, TMD partners with hospitals to optimize Medicaid/Medicare reimbursement by identifying and rectifying inaccurate diagnostic classifications. To accomplish this, TMD has built a proprietary machine learning program that mines over 34 million outcome records for patterns in diagnoses to identify patterns between patient records and the diagnoses and procedures associated therein. Using this benchmark, TMD’s automated client system screens hospital discharges for likely miscodings and alerts our Clinical Document Improvement (CDI) team who work with the hospital to identify and rectify the mistake.

Data Scientist,"About PerfectRec
PerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. We are starting with electronics, then other products such as cars and clothing, but ultimately we'll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you're reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)

We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. And making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We hope to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves.
We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. Ultimately, we will get more information about a user's specific needs from a few quick multiple-choice questions than Amazon or Google can deduce from a search query and their past browsing data. This will enable us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs.
A Small Team Where You Can Have A Big Impact
PerfectRec is a small, early-stage startup where you can have a big impact. Our founding team has experience building successful startups and working at big organizations, like Google, Amazon, Twitch and UC Berkeley. We are growing fast, and looking for people who are excited to build a new product where they can have a big impact.
Founder Led, Founder Funded
Our CEO Joe Golden bootstrapped his first startup, Collage.com, to ~$100m in revenue and a successful exit in March 2021. He's using some of the proceeds from that sale to launch PerfectRec and give us a long runway of at least 3 years to build a great team and outstanding decision-engine.
Working At PerfectRec
We are an all-remote company, so we don't care where you live as long as you work well in a fast-paced, collaborative remote environment.
PerfectRec is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are committed to finding the best candidates for every role and giving them the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Our all-remote structure enables us to recruit anywhere in the world, so our talent pool isn't limited to a few big cities, and our asynchronous structure allows our team to work when it's best for them. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
Learn more about how we work and our differentiating values.
What You'll Bring
Strong sense of ownership. Ownership is taking responsibility for the outcomes of a task or project. You'll relish these ownership opportunities and ensure that tasks, projects, or the team are making positive forward progress.
Clear and concise communication. Building software is a team sport that relies heavily on great communication. You'll be responsible for clear, thoughtful, and concise written and verbal communication. This includes the ability to give and receive feedback with empathy and understanding whether in a code review or a 1:1.
Willingness to teach and learn. We're always evolving with new tools and practices. You'll be willing to jump in and learn unfamiliar technologies while also bringing others along with you. Mentorship and helping others learn are important parts of achieving this.
Creative problem solving. Creating a decision engine that can make recommendations across wide ranging domains is hard, and the potential data sources are limitless. You'll be able to evaluate and explore existing sets of data, suggest new sources of data, and be able to build models that learn from this data in novel ways.
Balance of perfection and pragmatism. Software has a lot of trade-offs and ways to solve problems. You'll be able to recognize and balance the trade-offs between long-term system health and bringing value to customers faster. Your tooling choices will reflect ability to solve the problem the best way and not just the latest and greatest.
What You'll Do
Create and explore datasets for powering recommendations, working closely with domain experts.
Prototype models for making recommendations in new domains.
Identify ways to evaluate and compare competing models.
Add new capabilities that are shared between models in different categories.
Solve technical problems across the stack and contribute to all parts of our code base, including creation of our internal machine learning library.
Share your expertise and experience to grow with the team.
Collaborate with product, design, and engineers to understand customer needs, design solutions, and prototype, launch, and iterate.
Build a product that is genuinely loved by users and respects their time.
Relevant Experience
We believe that everybody has the ability to learn and grow. So, relevant doesn't mean required or that you need everything on the list (this isn't a Pokédex). If you've used other tools, languages, and frameworks that are similar to what is listed, please apply! We only list specific tools so that you know the tech stack you're walking into.
Python or R.
Exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
Classical machine learning techniques like classification, regression, regularization, and cross-validation.
sklearn, Keras (or other deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch).
Recommender systems, including learning-to-rank.
SQL.
Technical writing.
Salary & Benefits
We believe in offering generous compensation and benefits tailored to our all-remote workplace. We pay well because we want to work with highly motivated people that will help make the company successful.
Pay Range and Level of Role
$130,000 - $300,000 salary and stock options which vest over 4 years. We are hiring data scientists with different levels of experience. Compensation is based on background and experience.
Benefits
100% remote and no cost-of-living pay cuts. We want you to work where you work best and we are not going to ""adjust"" your pay if you move somewhere with a lower cost of living.
We pay 100% of your and your dependents' healthcare premium in a high-quality, national PPO plan for US-based employees. For international employees, we will work with you if you're not covered by your national health plan.
We will buy the office equipment you need to succeed. Lots of companies are miserly about equipment. We are not going to do that because your time is valuable.
401k with generous matching. Once we have 20 employees, we'll set up a 401k program with generous matching.
Generous PTO. We trust everyone to take time off appropriately for themselves. We're pro-regular vacations - not taking regular breaks isn't good for individuals or the team. Once we have 20 employees, we will establish a more formal PTO policy.
Worry-free sick days. If you're sick, take the time off to get well. Just let your manager know as soon as practicable.
Free products that we're reviewing. We are becoming product experts together, and we will send you cool stuff like monitors and TVs as we add new recommendation lines.
