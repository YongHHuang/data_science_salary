Technically, the hiring manager describes the company's tech stack as divided into two: the legacy and the new.

These individuals should be able to mentor less experienced engineers, promote clarity, and possess a curiosity that drives them to ask good questionsFor future projects, that includes transitioning towards a microservices architecture and integrating with third-party systems. They aim to revolutionize the healthcare space, making navigation and optimization of benefits easier for everyone, much like how Uber and Airbnb disrupted their respective industriesThe hiring manager describes his management style as: ensuring the team's health, safety, and engagement. He values work-life balance and emphasizes the importance of teamwork. If you would like to learn more about this position, please apply. We're excited to #gorogue with you!
