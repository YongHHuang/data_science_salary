Leverage data analytics to develop and optimize reports and dashboards for executing newly created or modified procedures.  Test new process, procedure and technology releases to ensure seamless business operations during the execution of initiatives that impact the steady-state—i.e. major projects, software releases, vendor product upgrades, etc. Participate in change management planning and execution activities in support of these initiatives.  Collaborate with peers in data integrity, network, IT and lab engineering roles to develop solutions and execution plans for complex issues—i.e. security threat diagnosis, network performance optimization, persistent problems with a device platform, etc.  Track device events and alarms over pre-determined time frames to identify trends, conduct complex modeling, forecasting, and variance analysis to identify operational efficiencies.
