          Affirm is reinventing credit to make it more honest and friendly, giving consumers the flexibility to buy now and pay later without any hidden fees or compounding interest.Our mission: build honest financial products that improve lives. Affirm started because credit cards aren’t working. They lure us in with perks, but end up costing a lot: The average U.S. household has $6,000 in credit card debt. So we respond by building transparent, flexible and fair payment options for our customers, without any fees.One of Affirm’s growth pillars is to Win at Checkout. Eighty percent of our volume comes from Checkout–when a user decides to pay with Affirm at a merchant’s point of sale–today. The Checkout Experience Engineering team supports this pillar by both optimizing the existing product Checkout experience as well as building new product capabilities. The craft and quality our team puts into the Checkout product helps Affirm expand into new markets, show up on more merchant sites, and increase how much and how often people pay with Affirm.We are a full stack team where we seek not only to craft every pixel with care so as to delight our users, but also to respond within minutes to server availability issues affecting our customers. We are as obsessed about animations, kilobytes and accessibility as we are about comprehensible client contracts, asynchronous data fetching and idempotency.We are looking for an engineer who is as passionate about the mission of Affirm as we are. This person tolerates ambiguity, is a self-starter and can remove blockers by collaborating independently with teammates to get to a solution. This person enjoys some mob programming, appreciates the need to build consensus through technical writing, and both welcomes and seeks out recurring one-on-one’s within and outside of their team to extend collaborative reach.What You'll DoWork with technical leadership to lead cross-functional engineering build-out of new features at scale with product and design stakeholders and in coordination with across multiple service domains. Work in cross-functional teams to build out technical specifications, agree upon interfaces, author plans for testing, monitoring and observability of new functionality you drive to market. Build team culture by proactively embettering our team processes, by routinely engaging with your teammates and by building relationships across the organization on behalf of your team. Proactively identify technical deficiencies to help the team build out new ways to maintain their product. What We Look For2+ years of software development experience. Proven CS fundamentals and hands on coding and debugging experience using modern software delivery methods to develop APIs using Python/Kotlin/Node. Professional experience with front-end javascript framework(s) and Typescript. Having experience with GraphQL, Next.js or Remix is a plus.
