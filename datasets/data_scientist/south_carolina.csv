About the job What we do Integer Technologies is an applied research and product development company founded by scientists and engineers with a passion for technology and national security. We perform R&D on next-generation systems and technologies for the Department of Defense and other U.S. Government agencies. We are hardware and software developers with experience turning research into impactful products for military and commercial applications. Our core portfolio of research includes projects in controls and automation for electrical and machinery systems, perception systems for uncrewed vehicles (with an emphasis on maritime vehicles), digital twins and autonomy, and advanced manufacturing. We are a startup founded for the purpose of putting research into action. Our mission is to create a safer world by translating scientific discoveries into reliable products that address urgent national security needs… at the speed of relevance. Our perception systems portfolio includes work on critical enabling technologies for more reliable, more intelligent, and longer-duration uncrewed vehicles. We are actively developing a new perception system for ships that automatically detects objects on and just below the surface of the water, day or night, and in most weather conditions, by fusing sensor data from multi-spectral cameras and radar using reliable and validated computer vision algorithms. This perception system will be a key enabler for uncrewed ships to navigate safely without human intervention.   About the Role Integer seeks a Sensor Fusion Engineer with experience developing disparate camera, lidar, radar, IMU, and AIS sensor implementations into fused monolithic integrated systems for the Perception team. The Sensor Fusion Engineer will apply this experience at Integer Technologies toward prototyping new technology enabling uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) to understand their operating environment and navigate while avoiding obstacles and collisions. Experience with perception systems, rapid prototyping and epipolar integration for maritime vehicle applications, or the ability to transfer knowledge from other vehicles to the maritime domain is important.   Primary Responsibilities Provide technical subject matter expertise for the Company’s projects related to maritime environments with autonomous perception and sensor fusion for Autonomous Surface Vessels. Leverage experience with autonomous perception to design and implement multi-sensor arrays (electro-optical, infrared, radar, lidar) and fuse them into a combined world space surrounding a ship to improve autonomous navigation. Use prior experience with hands-on testing to develop and prototype sensor hardware, optimize builds, and test systems end to end to validate system performance. Research and develop electro-optical, radar, and lidar arrays and analyze sensor fusion techniques for valid metrics and relative effectiveness. Quickly iterate and deploy rapidly fabricated prototypes of data collection hardware to meet research project requirements. Provide domain knowledge for autonomous perception systems including technical analysis, experimental development, engineering, and product development. Execute individual medium-long term (e.g., monthly to quarterly) tasking with minimal oversight, delays, or rework. Proactively recommend your own medium-long term tasking to project leads. Communicate estimated time to complete tasks with infrequent need to extend and demonstrate sound time management. Proactively understand required technical work and address problems with minimal required oversight. Develop key content for deliverables including monthly reports, quarterly project reviews, and demonstration events. Regularly exercise technical prudence. Coordinate junior engineers to achieve medium term tasking. Support the Company as needed to develop new funded research and development projects. This includes, but is not limited to, engaging with government stakeholders to understand priorities and gaps related to the Company’s capabilities͕ supporting the development of white papers and proposals and building relationships with university and industry partners. Embody Integer’s core values: Integrity, Agility, Growth, Open-Mindedness, Commitment.  Qualification Requirements Must be a U.S. Citizen with the ability to obtain a US DoD Secret clearance. Deep understanding of topics in sensor fusion, autonomous vehicles / robotics, rapid prototyping and perception sensor solutions. Bachelor’s degree in engineering, computer science, or related technical discipline. 2+ years of industry experience as an engineer working on hardware design, system architecture, image/sensor analysis, perception sensors such as cameras and radar, and on vehicle computing. Strong working knowledge of low-level software development using modern C++ and Python where applicable to develop and rapidly integrate sensor systems. Excellent written and oral communication skills. Ability to travel occasionally, estimated at less than 10% of the time.  Additional Desired Qualifications Experience working on other aspects of autonomous vehicles, such as autonomous navigation and path planning. Experience with maritime autonomy (e.g., autonomous surface vessels or autonomous underwater vehicles). Masters or Ph.D. in computer vision, robotics, autonomous vehicles, sensor fusion, mechanical design, or related field. Track record of transitioning to production from R&D. Company Benefits Integer fully covers medical, prescription, vision, and dental insurance costs for the employee and dependents. Meaning Integer standard plan pays 100% of health insurance premiums for your entire family from a well-known national insurer, saving its employee’s thousands of dollars annually. Relocation assistance available. Base salaries which exceed local & national industry averages. Year-end performance-based bonuses. 401(k) with company matching that vest immediately; no funny business. Paid Vacation Paid Sick Leave Paid Holidays  Company Perks Startup culture with the stability of a large company. Integer’s business plan has years of time phased contracted work, alleviating the would-be risk from a traditional small company. Direct access to company leadership, prioritization of people over process, and a stellar team with a shared desire for personal and professional growth. Friendly atmosphere where people enjoy not only their work and what they're creating but enjoy helping each other as well. Bottomless Coffee!
