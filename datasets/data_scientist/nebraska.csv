          Hi, we're CompanyCam.We're a simple-to-use photo documentation and productivity app for contractors of all commercial and home services industries. Packed with intuitive functionality, CompanyCam facilitates unparalleled communication and accountability across a contractor's entire business. We're committed to providing a consumer-grade, game-changing experience that helps our users build trust within their company and with their customers.But don't let that corporate description fool you—the people behind our buttoned-up product are laid-back (but hardworking), genuine, and kickass, and you could be one of them!The RoleWe're looking for a sharp, self-motivated, problem-solving Senior Backend Engineer to join our team.As a Senior Ruby on Rails Developer, you'll work alongside other engineers, designers, and product managers to tackle everything from huge company initiatives to modest but important bug fixes, from start to finish. You'll also collaborate with your product team on discovery, helping to assess the direction and feasibility of product changes.Most importantly, you'll actively contribute to the evolution of the culture and processes of a growing engineering team, especially our backend engineering discipline. We want senior devs with experience effectively scaling codebases and iterating on processes as part of a growing team and with interest in mentoring to help our devs grow, too.Working at CompanyCamOur engineering team is remote-first, spanning every time zone in the United States. We welcome people from all backgrounds and really don't care whether or not you have a CS degree or even a high school diploma. All that matters is that you're not an a**hole and you're good at what you do.Our Product and Engineering departments also do things a little differently than what you might be used to.We use a customized version of Basecamp's Shape Up method (fused with empowered product teams a la Marty Cagan's Inspired) to organize and execute our work. That means you'll work in a close-knit team consisting of a product manager, a product designer, and other engineers on an area of the product in 3-week cycles.During cycles you'll spend most of your time implementing product improvements, but you'll also work with your team shaping (generating and vetting) product improvements for the next cycle. After each cycle your team will stop, reset, and choose to tackle another cycle or take a 1-2 week cool-down (a period of undirected work where you'll pursue educational opportunities, work on pet projects, or smash some bugs that have been nagging at you). Rinse and repeat until code nirvana.Sounds nice, right? No sprinting, no scrumming, no death by 1,000 meetings. We protect our engineers' time, treat them like adults, and trust them to get their work done. We're also big on not overworking people. Put in your eight hours of focused, quality work and then TURN. SLACK. OFF. No nights and weekends.Our larger company culture is also refreshingly chill. We have fun, learn from each other, and don't take ourselves too seriously.We cover the important stuff too. We pay well, offer unlimited vacation, meaningful equity, health insurance, and other benefits. This is a salaried position at CompanyCam. The starting point of our salary band for mid-level engineers is $130,000. The top of our salary band for senior engineers is $170,000.What We Ask of YouMust-havesThese are our non-negotiables:Show up: have the courage to do difficult but necessary stuff.Grow up: take responsibility, learn continuously, and have a growth mindset.Do good: treat your co-workers and customers the way you want to be treated.Strong experience with and knowledge of Ruby on Rails.Experience building and maintaining third-party integrations.5 or more years of experience working as a professional software developer. (Not all years of experience are created equal, so this one isn't set in stone).Reside permanently and currently somewhere in the U.S. Alas, we're not set up to hire outside of the U.S.Nice-to-havesDay to day, you'll spend 90%+ of your time working in Ruby on Rails, but, of course, that's not all you'll work with. While experience with the following technologies are not required (we're cool with some on-the-job learning), you will see them with varying levels of frequency:GraphQL & RESTPostgreSQLRedisAWS services (S3, EC2, etc)ElasticSearchMongoDBAbout CompanyCamCompanyCam is a fun, fast-paced team united by our core values of Show Up, Grow Up and Do Good.

Apply here if you are an exceptional Go, Rust, or C/C++ software engineer and want to work on next-generation open source VMM or container technology, or related open source networking and storage.Container, virtualisation and cloud infrastructure have become essentials of modern software deployments. We invest in open source related to application isolation, workload orchestration, system or OCI containers, micro service architecture or cloud infrastructure.Here are some examples of projects under way at Canonical.RustVMM has great potential as a new hypervisor for Linux. We are building a team to work on this, with an emphasis on performance, security and operability. Work in Rust and bring your expert knowledge of VMM and related kernel networking and storage capabilities.Docker images are easy to make and publish on Docker Hub and other registries, but the quality, consistency and security maintenance of those images is broadly very poor. Canonical is in a good position to publish a portfolio of outstanding Docker images. Our Rockcraft team is designing and implementing an elevated Docker image experience for the open source community.LXD is a modern system container and virtual machine manager that is widely used on Ubuntu, ChromeOS and other Linux platforms. LXD engineering spans the entire software stack from low-level kernel work on namespaces, confinement, security, filesystems, VMMs and networking, to the high level management REST API and CLI.Members of the Kubernetes product team build MicroK8s for on-rails K8s, and Charmed Kubernetes for more sophisticated integration.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch : Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. Our Client Our client connects software to the messy, unstructured data that businesses encounter every day. Their goal is to bring about a world where computers do the work that computers are best at (processing large volumes of data) so that humans can do what humans are best at (critical thinking and empathy).The first piece of this problem that they're tackling is document parsing. Even as software is eating the world, so many business workflows still rely on two entities sending PDFs to each other. In a single afternoon with their product, developers can ship a production-ready API endpoint that turns documents into useful data. Today, we have happy customers across insurance, logistics, proptech, and financial services using Sensible to process thousands of different types of documents.They were founded in 2020 and are backed by some of the top investors in Silicon Valley.About The RoleAs a lead frontend engineer, you’ll work closely with our head of engineering and the rest of the engineering team to define the best practices for and build features in the Sensible web app.Sensible is a remote-first company and this role is open to anyone located in North or South America. We provide competitive compensation and meaningful equity. What you’ll do   Define the patterns and best practices for our React-based web app.  Our web app is a static Next/React app served directly from S3 with an integrated Monaco-based IDE.  You will define and help implement more consistent, testable patterns across the app and expand our automated test coverage.  We have a reasonable amount of coverage with Cypress currently, but still need to do manual testing before releases, whereas in contrast our backend has essentially full test coverage and no manual testing requirement.  Build new user interfaces powered by LLMs that solve real business problems.  Choose new frontend technologies judiciously.  Collaborate with marketing, sales, and customer success teams to ship the features that matter the most to our prospects and customers.   About you  You might be a fit if... You have 5+ years of experience building complex web apps.  You’re product-minded and customer-focused.  Experience leading projects from a technical perspective  You are an excellent verbal and written communicator, able to build relationships with different kinds of people across different levels of the organization. Nice to have: Experience building vertical (e.g., insurtech, logistics, finserv, proptech) B2B SaaS apps.  Willingness to occasionally be a technical voice in customer and prospect conversations.  You have experience working in organizations compliant with SOC 2 and HIPAA.  Salary Range: $100,000 - $160,000 base + equity
