The SupplyPike company pillars are: Curiosity: We constantly challenge prevailing thought by first seeking to understand the problem domain, strategy, market, and technology. We know that innate curiosity is crucial for building better, customer-driven products. Collaboration: While there may be an “i” in SupplyPike, we embrace interdisciplinary talents and cross-collaboration across different teams. There are no sharp boundaries around responsibilities. We favor openness, transparency, and joining forces with the talented people around you. Agility: We want to give our customers what they need to succeed. We understand that building a product (even an MVP) isn’t worth the investment if the customer need is not validated. Iterating quickly and testing hypotheses with real customers as soon as possible drives our building stages. We avoid analysis paralysis by embracing that “perfect is the enemy of good.” Integrity: In layman’s terms - don’t make stuff up. We favor well researched knowledge over impromptu answers. This comes with a need for humility to understand the limits of our own knowledge. We understand making mistakes is a natural part of the process. Reflecting upon and learning from those mistakes is how we continue to grow. Empathy: We strive for an environment where being empathetic and considerate for the concerns of others is always top of mind. We take a ‘no blame’ approach by speaking with frankness about problems and solutions, but always avoiding personal attacks. Rudeness and condescension are kept at bay. Play: Changing an entire industry is hard work. We take our work seriously but never ourselves. We see problems as exciting puzzles; we see people as the invaluable contributors to the SupplyPike spirit. We embrace creativity, experimentation, and engagement, all while never compromising on the human experience and authenticity. Determination: Challenges and setbacks are a given. We see them as opportunities to learn, drive innovation, and continuously improve. We embody an unwavering commitment to achieving ambitious goals and overcoming challenges. We thrive in the face of adversity, constantly seek improvement, and refuse to settle for mediocrity.SupplyPike BenefitsAll SupplyPike employees are critical to our success, and our compensation philosophy is aimed to attract and reward top talent responsibly. We believe in competitive pay, directly linking compensation to performance, ensuring fairness, and being transparent about our approach.
