This makes it a high priority for research efforts aimed at improving resuscitation outcomes. Traumatic injury, including extremity trauma and hemorrhage, results in an inflammatory response that affects multiple pathways and can lead to vascular dysfunction (i.e., leakage). Resuscitation following hemorrhage without or with ET has been shown to have impacts on endotheliopathy. This project will provide a clinically relevant model of trauma-induced endotheliopathy as it relates to the ANG-TIE pathway. Our overall hypothesis is that modulation of the ANG-TIE pathway, through pharmacological intervention at time of resuscitation, will reduce damage and/or heal the vascular endothelium, leading to reductions in trauma-induced endotheliopathy and improved resuscitation outcomes.Why should I apply?Under the guidance of a mentor, you will gain hands-on experience to complement your education and support your academic and professional goals. Along the way, you will engage in activities and research in several areas. These include, but are not limited to,Developing a comprehensive understanding of various surgical techniques specific to working with ratsAcquiring an in-depth knowledge of rat anatomy and physiology as related to trauma and endotheliopathyDeveloping proficiency at post-operative care and monitoringPerforming hands-on surgical techniques with live animalsDocumenting all research in laboratory notebook and other research templatesUtilizing various government and commercial sources to maintain inventory of surgical supply and equipmentWhere will I be located?
