          Affirm is reinventing credit to make it more honest and friendly, giving consumers the flexibility to buy now and pay later without any hidden fees or compounding interest.Our mission: build honest financial products that improve lives. Affirm started because credit cards aren’t working. They lure us in with perks, but end up costing a lot: The average U.S. household has $6,000 in credit card debt. So we respond by building transparent, flexible and fair payment options for our customers, without any fees.One of Affirm’s growth pillars is to Win at Checkout. Eighty percent of our volume comes from Checkout–when a user decides to pay with Affirm at a merchant’s point of sale–today. The Checkout Experience Engineering team supports this pillar by both optimizing the existing product Checkout experience as well as building new product capabilities. The craft and quality our team puts into the Checkout product helps Affirm expand into new markets, show up on more merchant sites, and increase how much and how often people pay with Affirm.We are a full stack team where we seek not only to craft every pixel with care so as to delight our users, but also to respond within minutes to server availability issues affecting our customers. We are as obsessed about animations, kilobytes and accessibility as we are about comprehensible client contracts, asynchronous data fetching and idempotency.We are looking for an engineer who is as passionate about the mission of Affirm as we are. This person tolerates ambiguity, is a self-starter and can remove blockers by collaborating independently with teammates to get to a solution. This person enjoys some mob programming, appreciates the need to build consensus through technical writing, and both welcomes and seeks out recurring one-on-one’s within and outside of their team to extend collaborative reach.What You'll DoWork with technical leadership to lead cross-functional engineering build-out of new features at scale with product and design stakeholders and in coordination with across multiple service domains. Work in cross-functional teams to build out technical specifications, agree upon interfaces, author plans for testing, monitoring and observability of new functionality you drive to market. Build team culture by proactively embettering our team processes, by routinely engaging with your teammates and by building relationships across the organization on behalf of your team. Proactively identify technical deficiencies to help the team build out new ways to maintain their product. What We Look For2+ years of software development experience. Proven CS fundamentals and hands on coding and debugging experience using modern software delivery methods to develop APIs using Python/Kotlin/Node. Professional experience with front-end javascript framework(s) and Typescript. Having experience with GraphQL, Next.js or Remix is a plus. Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, related technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience. Experience building highly-crafted consumer-facing web application development to scale.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch : Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. Our Client Our client connects software to the messy, unstructured data that businesses encounter every day. Their goal is to bring about a world where computers do the work that computers are best at (processing large volumes of data) so that humans can do what humans are best at (critical thinking and empathy).The first piece of this problem that they're tackling is document parsing. Even as software is eating the world, so many business workflows still rely on two entities sending PDFs to each other. In a single afternoon with their product, developers can ship a production-ready API endpoint that turns documents into useful data. Today, we have happy customers across insurance, logistics, proptech, and financial services using Sensible to process thousands of different types of documents.They were founded in 2020 and are backed by some of the top investors in Silicon Valley.About The RoleAs a lead frontend engineer, you’ll work closely with our head of engineering and the rest of the engineering team to define the best practices for and build features in the Sensible web app.Sensible is a remote-first company and this role is open to anyone located in North or South America. We provide competitive compensation and meaningful equity. What you’ll do   Define the patterns and best practices for our React-based web app.  Our web app is a static Next/React app served directly from S3 with an integrated Monaco-based IDE.  You will define and help implement more consistent, testable patterns across the app and expand our automated test coverage.  We have a reasonable amount of coverage with Cypress currently, but still need to do manual testing before releases, whereas in contrast our backend has essentially full test coverage and no manual testing requirement.  Build new user interfaces powered by LLMs that solve real business problems.  Choose new frontend technologies judiciously.  Collaborate with marketing, sales, and customer success teams to ship the features that matter the most to our prospects and customers.   About you  You might be a fit if... You have 5+ years of experience building complex web apps.  You’re product-minded and customer-focused.  Experience leading projects from a technical perspective  You are an excellent verbal and written communicator, able to build relationships with different kinds of people across different levels of the organization. Nice to have: Experience building vertical (e.g., insurtech, logistics, finserv, proptech) B2B SaaS apps.  Willingness to occasionally be a technical voice in customer and prospect conversations.  You have experience working in organizations compliant with SOC 2 and HIPAA.  Salary Range: $100,000 - $160,000 base + equity
