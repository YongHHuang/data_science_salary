Smartsheet exposure/experience is a plus. Also, intent is to renew contract dependent on performance and budget. ***12 month contract with probability of extension and most likely FTE conversion***DescriptionThe Project Manager hired will be assigned to external customer facing and/or internal cost reduction projects. This individual will participate in activities ranging initial discovery and scoping of project parameters through project closure and transition including planning and execution phases. Particular attention should be given to publication of project data and provided project documentation templates. For internal cost reduction projects, the Project Manager will be expected to build a custom WBS by way of individual interviews and team brainstorming sessions. Once sequencing of events and dependencies are identified, the Project Manager is expected to create a project gantt and to maintain an associated RAID document.The above processes and expectations will be repeated from project to project and program data will need to be gathered and represented in a published form for business review and decision making. The Project Manager hired will be expected to speak to both the project details as well as the program data gathered.Additional Notes: PMP required. An ideal amount of experience would be 5 - 7 yrs in 2+ roles. Project Coordinator or Project Analyst is not the same as Project Manager and need not apply. Data Analytics experience (gathering and organizing raw data into usable information) is necessary but could come from a range of backgrounds.Good communication is an absolute must - the “ums” and “uhs” every other word isn’t going to go over well for Laboratory Directors. The ability to create a “WBS” from the bottom up is a must (specialized PM skillset). pFMEA (Process Failure Modes Effects Analysis) is ideal and comes from an Engineering or Quality Management Systems (QMS) background. Smartsheet experience is a plus /preferred but not required.Intent is to turn contract hires into FTEs so I want someone who isn’t just a good fit for the current role but brings something new to the team that will help us grow. I can’t afford to compromise on human resources and skillsets b/c of the high impact, visibility, and accountability this team has.
