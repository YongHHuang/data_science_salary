IT Business Analyst  Location: RemoteDuration: 3-4 months with possible contract to hireDescription: This individual works as part of an IT project team, partnering with MP&A business partners to align technology solutions with business strategies by eliciting, analyzing, communicating and validating requirements for changes to business processes and information systems. For this scoping and implementation effort, these activities include documenting requirements, producing process flows, and documents functional specifications for moderately complex business processes. This individual would also support development of high level implementation plans and manage project activities based on a strong functional knowledge of applications and industry requirements.Solution Design, Development and Delivery: Lead Business solution requirement and design discussions; create functional designs, configuration, and final scope statement deliverables for enhancements or projects.Understand business needs and utilize/refine designs for applications to ensure functionality and capabilities meet the Business needs.Lead review sessions with user groups and cross functional technical teams.Align functional design with technical requirements. Support solution build through strong partnership with the development team.Own and lead project meetings to ensure deliverables are met, ensuring meetings have agendas, objectives are clear, and meetings are facilitated effectively and efficiently.Own and deliver project communication, including regular status updates on all aspects of the project (in collaboration with the project manager when applicable).Provide feedback and input on feasibility of technology solutions and identify opportunities for improvements to ensure Business needs are met.Prepare test scenarios for TUT/FIT/UAT phases of project and enhancement work; collaborate with the Testing Center of Excellence in mapping test scenarios to functional requirements and design.Understand and identify data needs, system data flow requirements, and recognizes risk or impacts to business process or to adjoining systems or applications.Surfaces issues, concerns, gaps in technology designs, and works to address these timely to mitigate risk and missed technical requirements.Reports to Applications Director. Bachelor’s degree in computer science, Information Systems, Business Administration, or other related field and 5-7 years of experience in business systems analysis or applications programming.Top 3 to 5 skills: Business process facilitation and documentation, Solution design and documentation, Collaboration and Partnership with strong verbal and written communication, Attention to detail and detail oriented work, Self-motivated and able to work independently and as part of a group, Support testing - IT testing (functional integration testing and functional unit testing) as well as support User Acceptance testing (UAT) and end to end integration testing. Provide a little background on the department and the team they will be working on: Merchandise Planning & Allocation IT team, working closely with Merch Planning, Demand Forecasting and Inventory Allocation business partners. Yes, we are in the scoping and initial requirements/design phase project, which will become an implementation project which we’re targeting to get approval on in June/July and we’d want this resource to remain on and shift over to that implementation project. We also have another international inventory related project which may require some cross over with this effort.Some things that would stand out from candidates:  Retail merch planning, supply chain planning or inventory deployment/allocation experience would be helpful, or any experience with inventory control since this project is focused on segmentation of inventory, virtually, for various intended uses.Typical Day Look like in this role as far as workload:  Meetings - with business, internally with the project team, or cross functionally with other IT teams or combination working through details of the project effort. Independent or team work on creation of documentation and discussions on solution design; participation in providing status updates and engagement in project status meetings; as the project progresses, working with the testing team on use cases to be tested, doing testing individually on the solution, and supporting the Business through user acceptance testing and go live, as well as likely some post go live support.Would you consider a recent graduate (or years of experience):  we would ideally want a candidate with ~5 or more years of experience at this time. If we cannot find someone that is a good fit, we may consider less, but this would be at minimum a mid level role.Personality/Cultural fits needed to be successful:  we would be looking for someone who is well spoken, able to lead conversations and meetings in group settings and is comfortable doing so. Our team is a blend of cultural Backgrounds, and work experiences. We work very collaboratively and expect that we can have a contractor who is a good blend with the team and is able to follow similar workflow and practices.Technical/Methodology:  Does this team operation in a more agile or waterfall methodology:  I believe we’d work in a sprint manner, but would not necessarily release development iteratively. So we’d likely take a hybrid approach between the two.Is there a certain development methodology your team practices:  we typically manage the development work in 2 week sprints, but have not had many instances where we’d release new development iteratively because in most cases we’re building a brand new application, which would need a “big bang” release.If candidates don’t have experience with the preferred technology, would you consider any additional technical tools:  It’s isn’t a block if a candidate hasn’t worked in either an agile or waterfall method, however would ask for the flexibility and willingness to learn based on our aligned upon approach for the effort.What percentage of the candidate’s time will be in one technology vs another:  This candidate would be initially 100% dedicated to the project effort supporting design and creation of a virtual inventory separation application and the data flow processes and business processes that correspond to it.As an equal opportunity employer, ICONMA prides itself on creating an employment environment that supports and encourages the abilities of all persons regardless of race, color, gender, age, sexual orientation, citizenship, or disability.
