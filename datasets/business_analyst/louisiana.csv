Posting End Date Work Place Flexibility:  Onsite Legal Entity:  Entergy Services, LLCThis position may be filled as an Advanced Grid Ops Analyst I or II depending on the qualification level of the applicant. Job Summary/PurposeThe Advanced Grid Operations Analyst (AGOA) is responsible for monitoring advanced grid equipment and ensuring secure connectivity, configuration and device performance. Examples of advanced grid devices include advanced meters, smart streetlights, intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) such as recloser or capacitor bank controls, and integrated distributed energy resources (DERs) such as batteries or utility-controlled customer loads like smart thermostats. AGOAs will monitor and analyze event and alarm data and provide the first tier response from a control center environment. Working closely with network and data integrity analysts, Advanced Grid Ops Analysts will determine if any issues with device performance are local to a specific device or due to broader problems with telecom networks or IT systems. Incident tickets will be routed to the appropriate group to resolve—i.e. telecom field resources, OpCo servicemen, IT support, etc. AGOAs are also responsible for planning and implementing configuration changes to devices over the network—typically for a large population of devices. Configuration changes can include device firmware, programming, or settings changes.For example, Advanced Grid Ops Analysts will be supporting resources in the AMI Operations Center (also known as “AMOC”) responsible for day-to-day monitoring and maintenance of revenue meter reliability in an AMI operational environment. During both deployment and steady-state, individuals in this role will ensure that meter reads are consistently communicated between the devices (meters) and the head-end system, and that any issues or incidents preventing communication or data are triaged and addressed in a timely manner.The Advance Grid Ops Analyst will manage connected-grid devices and the software platforms that are integrated with them.
