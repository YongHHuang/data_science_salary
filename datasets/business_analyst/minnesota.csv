Campus was designed as a portal allowing users to interact directly with the system and the department. Campus is supported by a Product team using Agile and Product management approaches to manage the backlog of defects, new features, and enhancements. There is a substantial backlog of work to be done on the system to meet the users' needs and support users in completing their business processes. Existing staff resources are unable to make progress on the backlog of defects while also developing new features.The developers under this engagement will be working in partnership with existing MNIT staff to improve the Campus system based on user stories as prioritized by the product team and product manager. As members of the product team, the developers will be working closely with other team members (including those in roles such as scrum master, business analyst, quality assurance, and enterprise architect) and users to identify user needs, develop code to meet those needs, document the code changes, and present the system changes to the product manager and users.The Campus system is built from .NET (back-end) and Angular (front-end) which are being upgraded to more current versions. The product team uses Jira for managing the backlog and assignment of work. Campus is a custom-built system based on the technical requirements collected which resulted in complex code. The system uses Azure-hosted microservice architecture and a complex design framework with minimal design and code documentation which makes it challenging to address defects and resolve issues that arise.Sample TasksDevelop .NET and Angular code for defect fixes and new features/enhancements based on user stories.Swarm with other developers to troubleshoot blockers and brainstorm solutions.Participate in daily stand-up meetings to provide updates on work, identify blockers, and stay informed of the priorities for upcoming work.Participate in biweekly sprint review meetings to present system changes to users and stakeholders to ensure the changes are meeting their needs.Participate in other product team ceremonies such as sprint planning, backlog refinement, and sprint retrospectives.Perform functional testing.Document code changes.Update and manage assigned Jira tickets.Provide knowledge transfer to State staff.Perform other related duties as assigned.Minimum Qualifications:Three (3) years' experience as a full stack developer in .NETThree (3) years' experience as a full stack developer in AngularThree (3) years' development experience using MS SQL ServerDesired Qualifications:Experience working in an Agile/Product environmentExperience developing in and/or upgrading to .NET6Experience developing in and/or upgrading to Angular 15 Experience using Atlassian Jira/ConfluenceExperience working in the Workers' Compensation area/industryInterview ProcessInterviews will be conducted via Microsoft Teams.The State will conduct interviews with a short list of the highest scoring candidates.
