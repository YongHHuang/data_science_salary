          Product Manager/Technical Developer AnalystLocation: onsite 2 weeks per month in Durham, NC or Westlake, TX, Boston, MA Merrimack, NH New JerseyFolks with some development experience who've transitioned into BA/ Product Management Roles should have some understanding of the above even if their experience is with Python/ Ruby/ C#, Java/ C++ etc (they hopefully understand how systems are designed and what exactly a developer would need for a user story). However, we don't want folks with prior development experience alone, since we want the person to be comfortable owning the business side of things as well.Generally we need a fast learner with critical thinking skills - that can break down all system interdependencies in deep detail. General brokerage experience works. With respect to seniority/ experience -The main reason we're looking for seniority is becauseWe want someone who can work quite independently and handle conversations with stakeholders (business & tech)We don't want to have to train a consultant on Agile/ System analysis deliverables/ technologies etc., (and ideally, neither on our customer/ accounts domain)However, what we've seen with certain experienced folks - Resistance to go deep, confidence in incorrect assumptions based on their previous experience, or they avoid creating analysis deliverables in a structured manner because their previous roles may not have required them toOr when we have some experienced folks sincerely trying, it is sometimes truly an inability to fully grasp new solutions/ systems/ requirements in a fast-paced environment. They would be better fit for roles in a slower paced environment in an established team, where you're not solving a new problem (new business problems, new technical patterns) everyday.On the other hand - we've observed that certain developers/ analysts who've recently joined the team are just naturally good at learning & breaking down problems - even without the necessary domain experience. And they end up performing significantly better than hires with experience in the domain. Which is why we are thinking that domain experience would only be a nice-to-have if the person is high-performing and has the right talent/ skills.Expected Employment Duration -6 months plus another year extension**This is not a Business Analyst role. We are looking for someone that worked previously as a developer and has moved to a more product management/technical analyst role. Sample resume attached.**Job Requirements -College graduate in a technical degree that is driven to meet, or exceed, expectations.Transferable expertise in post trade lifecycle for Equity & Derivatives products.Knowledge of basic accounting principles (GAAP).Desired Skills & Experience -Familiarity with Cloud Platforms (AWS) and SaaS platforms a plusDeep understanding of Agile development methodologyAbility to research and learn new technologies.Proficient using Confluence & JIRAExperience working with geographically distributed teamsAbility to think strategically and accept technical direction.Mid Senior level (maybe 5-8 years of total work experience)Full stack development experience (e.g. Java/ APIs/ DBs/ some system design) for majority of their career (i.e. it's ok if they don't have significant BSA experience)Has shown recent experience or proof of being able to perform in a BSA/ Product management role (e.g. 1 year of experience in a BSA/ Product Management role). We don't want people who are only primarily interested in technical implementation, and aren't interested in eliciting business needs and requirements.Has to be a strong, concise communicator. This is something we would rely on your team to vouch for since they wouldn't have had much prior BSA experience to exhibit their communications experience in the workplace. We would want to avoid include folks that may show one of the following behaviors -Use a lot of tech buzzwords - and/or are unable to adapt their answers in a way that is understandable by the listenerCircle around the point or ramble or when asked a direct questionUnable to lead/ initiate conversations confidently
